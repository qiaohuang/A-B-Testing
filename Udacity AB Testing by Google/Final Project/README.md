# Final Project _(Lesson 6)_

## Project overview

In this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment. The [project instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub?embedded=True) contain more details.

## Project format

The project will have both qualitative and quantitative components. You can verify your answers to the quantitative questions using the quizzes in this lesson. Your qualitative answers will not be evaluated with classroom graders. Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OX2KDSHI9mSCriyGIATpRGscIW2JmByMd0ITqKYvNg/edit?usp=sharing) to help organize your thoughts. (If you would like to create your report using Google Docs, you can copy this template using "File > Make a copy" if you are signed into Google Drive.) We recommend not adding your quantitative answers to your report until you have correctly passed all the quizzes.
